# @obsidize/rotating-file-stream

A cordova/ionic flavor for rotating file streams on mobile devices.

The primary goal of this module is to act as a transport outlet for [@obsidize/rx-console](https://github.com/jospete/obsidize-rx-console),
and to give an out-the-box working log-to-file solution for ionic mobile apps.
